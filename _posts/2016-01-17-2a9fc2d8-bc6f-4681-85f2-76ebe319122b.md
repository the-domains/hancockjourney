**Who are you and your family?**

Mark and Becky Hancock

We have three daughters: Marissa who works as a pet stylist and lives in Schenectady ) with her husband Nick.  They have two beautiful children, Faith and Calvin.  Emily and Maggie are at home working and seeking the Lord.

**Where do you serve and with what mission agency? **

We serve with Wycliffe Associates and are based at the headquarters in Orlando, FL. Our ministry has a global impact on the acceleration of Bible Translation.

**What is your ministry?**

I serve as the Advocate Team Leader within headquarters. I serve with both the recruiting team and the HR team. My position involves administrative work and managing three teams of volunteers: the advocate team (5 people), re-mobilizer team, and banquet team (5 people).  Our ministry within each team is to respond to the people who are interested in volunteering, share the opportunities, and encourage people to follow the Lord's leading. Candidates come to us through our internet inquiries, phone calls, and by walk-ins. We gather basic information from candidates on where they want to serve, when, their skills, their testimonies, as well as checking references and running background checks if needed. We work directly with the recruiters to find qualified candidates to fill the greatest needs on the field. This ministry allows me to be an encourager to Christians, but also to talk with non-believers who are looking for paid or volunteer positions and have no clue who we are and our purpose, which is to accelerate Bible translation so that every language that still needs a Bible written in its tongue has one in process by the year 2025\.

As Technology Advancement Orlando Operations Manager, Mark serves on the front lines of Bible translation.  By delivering technology and power to mother tongue translators they are able to do their job faster and more accurately than ever before.  Mark is also responsible for developing, leading and managing teams to research, test and implement new technology solutions that meet Wycliffe Associates' strategic goals.

**How has the Lord worked in your lives?**

It has been over seven years since we moved to Orlando to serve with Wycliffe Associates. Not only has the Lord continued to provide for our needs financially, but He has provided for each of our children. Our life is an adventure. We hear from people in Indonesia, Cameroon, and Brazil, to name a few, that are so grateful that we are helping God's written word reach their people. God has proven Himself faithful over and over again. Where we are weak He provides strength. He has encouraged us through His people by emails and notes, prayers and gifts. He has stretched us and put us in situations that we have never been in before forcing us to rely on His strength and His words.

Since 1967, Wycliffe Associates has supported the worldwide efforts of Wycliffe Bible Translators.  Through volunteer programs in local communities and overseas, WA provides hands-on opportunities and personal involvement for those interested in accelerating the translation of the Bible for indigenous peoples.  The field of computer technology has hastened translation work as well as communications between those serving in the field.  We must get God's Word into the hands of people groups in the language that speaks to their hearts so that they too can know the saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  It is our passion to share God's Word with all people, nations, and tribes.  We want to witness the fulfilling of Revelation 7:9\.

WA is a faith mission with prayer as the foundation.  We are thanking God for this opportunity to serve and trusting Him to supply all of our needs through churches, friends and families who are willing to become partners in our ministry.

Mission work is a team effort.  We are each called to pray, to send, or to go.  Each is equally important in sharing God's Word.
